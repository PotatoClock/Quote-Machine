"It's weird. They always travel in groups of five. These programmers, there's always a tall, skinny white guy; short, skinny Asian guy; fat guy with a ponytail; some guy with crazy facial hair; and then an East Indian guy. It's like they trade guys until they all have the right group.@Gavin",
"Richard, if you're not an asshole, it creates this kind of asshole vacuum, and that void is filled by other assholes, like Jared. I mean, you almost gave him shares. You need to completely change who you are, Richard. A complete teutonic shift has to happen.@Erlich",
"I always knew I was missing something, and then when someone explained the concept of ‘game’ I remember very distinctly thinking ‘That’s what I don’t have.’@Hendriks",
"If we can make your audio and video files smaller, we can make cancer smaller. And hunger. And... AIDS.@Gavin",
"Fucking Goolybib, man. Those guys build a mediocre piece of software that might be worth something someday, and now they live here. Money flying all over Silicon Valley but none of it ever seems to hit us.@Bighead",
"Don't touch anything! Failure is contagious.@Erlich",
"But Hooli was like an abusive spouse to me. You know, like that guy who married Julia Roberts in 'Sleeping With The Enemy'? It was dehumanizing. But then, you, Richard, you pulled me out of the life and you gave me hope and you gave me a sense of self-worth. Like Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman'. Every day here has been like that shopping-spree scene. I'm putting on hats.@Jared",
"Hooli isn't just about software. Hooli... Hooli is about people. Hooli is about innovative technology that makes a difference, transforming the world as we know it, making the world a better place through minimal message-oriented transport layers. I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness if first we achieve goodness.@Gavin on bullshitting",
"You just brought piss to a shit fight!@Erlich",
"Here's my app-date I was excited to work on it, and then I looked at it with fresh eyes. Um, Wajeed was right. It's really shitty. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.@Dinesh",
"Anyone who tells you their platform is faster than ours better have good lawyers.@Gavin",
"You'd like to fuck my code, wouldn't you? Hey, would you like to masturbate to the subroutine I just wrote?@Gilfoyle",
"No, no, don't think of it as a cubicle. Think of it as a neutral-colored enclosure about yay-high around your work space.@Jared",
"Jobs was a poser. He didn't even write code.@Richard",
"I don’t know how you did it, but you essentially aged 40 years in the last seven weeks. We had a meth addict in here this morning who was biologically younger than you are, and he’s 58. Myspace guy.@Richard's Doctor",
"You know who else is Canadian? Justin Bieber. The Hitler of music..@Dinesh",
"I own 10% of Pied Piper.@Erlich"
